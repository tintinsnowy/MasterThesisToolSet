First, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Prof. Dr. Thomas Rose for the continuous support of my master thesis and research, for his patience, motivation, and immense knowledge, also my advisor Thomas Osterland for his insightful comments and encouragement, and last not least the second supervisor Prof. Prinz for his kindness and support. Their guidance helped me in all the time of research and writing of this thesis.
Second, I owe the success of my master study and this thesis to my parents, Jing Zhou and Ping Yang, and my boy friend, Meng Li. They supported me through the difficulties that I encountered during the work.
