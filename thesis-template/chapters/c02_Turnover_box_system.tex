Turnover box system, the term is unfamiliar with most of us, yet it tightly connects with
our daily life. Narrowly speaking, turnover box system aims to track the delivery of boxes
among the partners in a certain supply chain. Those boxes are containers of fruits, vegetables,
agricultural product,etc. In this chapter, I'll present the State-of-the-art-of the Supply Chain, and its demand, requirement, hopes and problem. Also transit boxes as foundation of the logistic Chain, how the blockchain system could be leveraged to boost the process.

\section{Supply Chain Management(SCM)} 
In traditional commerce, \textbf{Supply Chain Management} has been defined as the management of the flow of goods and services,\cite{sc1} involves the movement and storage of raw materials, of work-in-process inventory, and of finished goods from point of origin to point of consumption. SCM practice draws heavily from the areas of industrial engineering, systems engineering, operations management, logistics, procurement, information technology, and marketing.s

With the tide of information technology, and the call for adaption of ever-evolving global customer demands and expectations, supply chain is experiencing a period of significant change. Supply chains in 2017 are being asked to be more customer centric, with direct selling to individual consumers a real near-term possibility for many. They are expected to be both dynamic and agile to
meet customer needs, with the ability to respond more quickly than ever while maintaining accuracy
and integrity.\cite{sc2}

In a 2017 supply chain Research, it newly defined smarter Supply chain with the following five "Cs":\cite{sc3}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Connected}\\
	Connected means being able to access
	unstructured data from social media, structured data from the IoT, and more traditional data sets
	available.Integration with all data sources is critical to get informed and better analysis.
	\item \textbf{ Collaborative}\\
	IDC has estimated that over 50\% of the value creation in manufactured products
	comes from outside the traditional manufacturing enterprise. Most come from suppliers and range
	from simple contract manufacturing to specify intellectual property contributions to new products.
	Improving collaboration with suppliers is
	critical, and in the digitally enabled,  this increasingly means the use of cloud-based commerce networks to enable multi-enterprise collaboration and engagement.
	\item \textbf{Cyberaware}\\The ability of the supply chain to harden its systems and databases from cyberintrusions and hacks is critical. Besides attacks from couterparties or any malicious people, the prevention from database failure or any means of system breakdown, recovery from unexpected incidents are also important
	\item \textbf{Cognitively enabled}\\
	The AI platform becomes the modern supply chain's control tower by
	collating, coordinating, and conducting decisions and next best actions across the chain in an
	automated and timely way.Certain exceptions would require human
	intervention, but most of the supply chain would be automated and self-learning.
	\item \textbf{Comprehensive}\\
	Analytics capabilities must be scaled with data and in real time and insights must be comprehensive and fast.
\end{itemize}

\section{Logistics}
logistics, the part of supply chain management, is the process of planning, implementing and controlling procedures for the efficient and effective transportation and storage of goods including services and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption for the purpose of conforming to customer requirements and includes inbound, outbound, internal and external movements.

In order to realize the digitalized and smart supply chain, the modern Logistics, as the very essential part of the SCM, cannot come without roboticized, automatized process, telematics, Big Data, Cloud-based system.  Especially, the transport tool, that is, Turnover box draws the attention from companies, which are engaged in optimized the logistic process.

\textbf{Turnover Box}
The Turnover Box, also called Logistics Box or transit Box. In the Information age, it represents not purely the container of the goods, but integrates the relevant states, identity, channel, etc information.  

Thus Lufthansa Industry Solution proposed to setup a cloud-based platform integrated with Logistics Box, so that the clients can better track, check the goods, faster routing planning help to reduce the cost.

\section{Turnover Box System}
Why we focus on designing, developing and evaluating the Turnover Box System based on Blockchain? Not only because several exploration in this specific field expands and even successful user cases come out from enterprises like Lufthansa(as mentioned above), IBM, Deloitte. But also inspired by a client, who operates a company providing Turnover boxes to the participants(For example, agri-food suppliers, goods distributors, product retailers) in certain supply chains, wanted an efficient, fault-tolerant, integrated system based on Blockchain to help operate, manipulate and trace the boxes and the cash flow. 

Thus this thesis, standing from the perspective of a Turnover Box operator, will depict, develop an digitalized, effective, easy access blockchain based system, and evaluate whether the blockchain plaform fits well in this scenarios.

\subsection{challenges}
Broadly to examine the potential challenges and risk is critical for the software developing.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{transaction throughput}
	
		The latest statistic shows that every German consumes c.a. 70kg fruits per year.If we only take the city Düsseldorf with 660,000 people as an example, the whole city may need almost 7000-8000 boxes of fruits. So its not hard to imagine if we count in other agricultural products, and larger supply chain network in other cities.Such huge volume of transactions and data must be proceeded efficiently.
	\item \textbf{scalability}
		Its not hard to imagine that for a striving company to extend its business. While they add new partners,
		nodes and peers into their network, they also don't want the expansion obviously affect the user experience. And it also helps maintain the longevity of the Blockchain (which is also essential for a supply chain).In the KMPG's latest report Demand-driven supply chain, they ranked the scalability/
exibility as the third place.
		
	\item \textbf{transaction confidentiality}\\
		it may sound infeasible to require privacy in Blockchain. However,
		in real commercial world it is sometime essential and useful. e.g. the operator want to
		take different price strategies among its clients, or in order to protect the data privacy of the product suppliers, the data condentiality of the transaction really matters.
	\item \textbf{Robustness}
		For such a supply chain with various parties and transaction especially concerning payment, it is required that the system tough, dependable enough. The single-failure(usually happened in centralized system) should be avoided, to say least, the brokendown or defected system(ledger) should be recovered easily. And it's also the reason we adopt the blockchain to track the sflow.
\end{itemize}


\section{The benefit of Blockchain to the System}
Digitalization in Business is changing the way we conduct business, the way we communicate, transact and interact with customers. And they tightly depend on their supply chain. As clients demand more
transparency, the complexity of supply chains increases.
an effective and inexpensive way to trace each material used
in the final product is important in building confidence with
increasingly environmental and socially conscious consumers.

Since blockchain is recognized immutable, transparent, and redefines trust, enables secure, fast, trustworthy, and transparent solutions that can be public or private, those features are exactly required by the supply chain management in new era. 
Indeed some enterprises are actively trying out the exploration. For example:

\begin{itemize}
	\item IBM cooperates with Walmart aiming to create a fully transparent food safe system \cite{walmart}.
	\item Oliver Wyman provides an End-To-End Blockchain enabled Supply Chain.
\end{itemize} 


%(blockchain ubiquity)
Thus Blockchain could be used to address inefficiency, lacking transparency and visibility, etc in current systems. Blockchain’s
distributed ledger offers a means for exchanging assets in an open, secure protocol, which has interesting. To be more specify, how those issues are settle and how well they would perform will be our focus in this thesis.


Thus it is promising but also challenging to build supply chain capabilities with the aid of Blockchain which can result in greater levels of performance.
